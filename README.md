# Stamp - a fast and portable Cookiecutter

Stamp is a fast and portable Cookiecutter-compatible tool that generates projects from project
templates. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Cookiecutter, but with a focus on speed
and portability.

Unlike Cookiecutter, Stamp is written in Rust, has no dependencies, and does not require Python (or
any other runtime) to be installed on the system. This makes it ideal for use in environments where
Python is not available or where you want to avoid the overhead of installing Python and its
dependencies.
